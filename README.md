# Python-eel-GUI-example-list_my_files-
A python program that displays files in a given directory using the Python eel GUI as the user interface

Hi, as seen in the description above, this is a small program that makes use of the Python eel chrome gui.

The main aim of this program is to show the files in a given directory. It requires the user to enter the directory in the input field, after which the python program will look for sub-folders and files in the directory specified.

for example____
This program files are located at C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Python eel example\
this means the folder named 'web' and file named 'list_all_files.py' is located in \Python eel example
so we run the 'list_all_files.py' file and a chrome window which has been sized up in width and height would appear.
In this window, we have ----

      1.  Input field where the user will enter the directory of choice
      2.  Two buttons 
          (i) A search button (to list out the files in the directory entered into the input field)
          (ii) A back button (This button returns you back to your actual or original directory before you first ran the program)
      3.  A label that shows the curerent directory you are (while running and while being static)
      4.  A textarea field that lists the folders and files that was found by the program
      
      
So things are quite simple here, you could enter a directory in the input field like "C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\(name of the directory)" , "C:\Users\DELL\" , or even just a single name , "(name of directory)", as long as the directory is present in the folder in which the py script is.

Actually this is the first repo that i'll be creating and uploading, am looking to use the python eel gui for more complex tasks, as i love the ability for me to easily use HTML/CSS/BOOTSTRAP to suit my needs

PYTHON IS FUN, A BIG THANKS TO CHRIS KNOTT FOR CREATING THIS SIMPLE MODULE
